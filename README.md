# The Problem Statement
The online fashion retailer has been collecting a vast amount of customer reviews over time. These reviews reflect the diverse range of sentiments that customers have toward our products. However, manually analyzing each review to determine its sentiment can be time-consuming and impractical, given the volume of data. This is where our machine learning model comes in.

# The Solution
The solution involves leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. We have developed a sentiment analysis model that can automatically categorize customer reviews into sentiment classes, simplifying the process of understanding how customers feel about our products. This model can not only save time but also provide valuable real-time insights for our business.
